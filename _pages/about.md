I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/index.htm). My research interest includes brain-inspired computing, spiking neural networks, and reinforcement learning.
